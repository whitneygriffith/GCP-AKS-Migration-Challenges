# Challenge 1 

How can I rabbitmq messages to myself? 

You need to install docker and host RabbitMQ in a container in Azure. 

Then connect the two... 

# Challenge 2 

Your customer only wants messages about his orders.


# Other challenges

Can you deal with a down container? 
The one in the cloud? or the local one? 
Can you connect two container's together? (maybe use a logic app to tie them together?)
